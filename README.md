This is the repository of CVM8_CV, my pretty basic and barebone Chip8 VM !



It's written in C with SDL2 and SDL2_mixer !




IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE :

I used ChatGPT to generate the CMakeLists.txt file !

Why ? Because I wanted to write code, not spend time configuring the build system !

The only part of the CMakeLists.txt file made by me is the USE_NATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS parts !

No AI was used for the actual code of this project !


I recommend Clang as the compiler, but GCC probably works too !
